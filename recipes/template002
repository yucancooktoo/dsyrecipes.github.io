# Beef Stew Soup

## info  
* 2 hours 
* 6 servings  

## ingredients
* 4 garlic cloves minced garlic
* 2 lbs Beef Tri-Tip
* 5 cups of Beef broth
* 10 small mushrooms
* 3 medium celery sticks
* 3 medium carrots
* 4 cups chopped potatoes
* 1 large onion
* 1 cup tomato sauce
* 1 cup frozen sweet peas
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce
* 2 1/2 tsp italian herbs blend
* 2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley
* 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp tbsp paprika
* 2 tbsp butter
* ground pepper


## steps  
1. Start by choosing the right meat: I recommend using large, 1 1/2-inch chunks of beef tri-tip, beef roast or even beef short ribs. Preheat a large pan and sear the meat all over, giving it nice color. This step is going to add lots of flavor so don’t rush the process!
2. I love a good, chunky soup and this one is made with halved baby potatoes, carrots, sliced mushrooms and even peas! The baby potatoes are sweet and tender, making them perfect for this recipe. For the sweet peas, either fresh or frozen will work well.
3. And for the mushrooms, I recommend going with baby bella mushrooms – they’re firm in texture and delicious! After browning the mushrooms, I add a few tablespoons of flour, which will help thicken the stew as it cooks.
4. The beef and vegetables then combined with red wine, beef broth, tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce. If you don’t use wine for cooking, you can replace it with more beef broth but I highly recommend adding it. The wine will add lots of flavor that you just can’t get otherwise.
5. I also season the beef stew with smoked paprika and Italian herbs. Once the stew comes up to a boil, reduce the heat and it cook away for at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours – the longer it simmers, the softer and more tender the beef will be.
